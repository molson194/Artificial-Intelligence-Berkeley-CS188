"""
This file contains a Distancer object which computes and
caches the shortest path between any two points in the maze. It
returns a Manhattan distance between two points if the maze distance
has not yet been calculated.

Example:
distancer = Distancer(gameState.data.layout)
distancer.getDistance( (1,1), (10,10) )

The Distancer object also serves as an example of sharing data
safely among agents via a global dictionary (distanceMap),
and performing asynchronous computation via threads. These
examples may help you in designing your own objects, but you
shouldn't need to modify the Distancer code in order to use its
distances.
